Hi Folks,

This is Enterprise API implemented in Perl.
I needed API to work with device atlas json in perl, but unfortunatly there is none.
I wrote my own using PHP example.

http://deviceatlas.com/resourcecentre/Get+Started/Enterprise+API

it's not full, not all methodes are supported, but it will give you all attributes based on user-agent
