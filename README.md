DeviceAtlas Enterprise API in Perl
=================

Thank you very much to the initial work done by [darkonie](https://github.com/darkonie/Device-atlas-API-in-Perl "Maksym Naboka") for building a good starting point.

This work was done for [Oversee.net](http://www.oversee.net/ "Oversee.net") with use of the [DeviceAtlas Enterprise Liscense](http://deviceatlas.com/resourcecentre/Get+Started/Enterprise+API).

To test the API, run 
```
test.pl
```
 as follows:

```
./test.pl -j <path to DA JSON file> -l <User Agent log file>
```

The 'User Agent log file' should be a new line delimited file containing a sinlge UA per line.

Cheers!
